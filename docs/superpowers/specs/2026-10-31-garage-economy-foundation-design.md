# Garage Economy and Entitlement Foundation — SDD Design Spec and BDD Acceptance

**Repository:** https://github.com/weskao/skyline-rush
**Branch:** `feature/garage-economy-foundation`
**Wave:** 3 · **Source TODO:** 5.5, 5.7, 5.9
**Status:** DOCUMENTATION ONLY · **Date:** 2026-10-31
**Dependencies:** Garage VFX Skins merged; no live currency or payment implementation without separately approved economics.

## 1. Goals and boundaries (SDD)

Versioned catalog, ownership, trial, equipped preference and future reward/soft currency boundaries; keep future premium/store interfaces conceptual, no checkout. Local UI cannot mint paid items.

This branch's design is limited to the stated responsibilities. The separate source-of-truth requirements for the full project are in [the planning TODO](https://github.com/weskao/skyline-rush/blob/feature/ux-ui-combo-mobile-controls/TODO.md); do not confuse this branch's inherited older `TODO.md` with the newer planning file.

## 2. Baseline and intended architecture

Current implementation paths to inspect first:
- `src/appearance.ts`
- `src/garage-ui.ts`
- `src/cloud-progress.ts`
- `src/history-storage.ts`

Design choices: isolate event/state contracts from presentation, use Vue 3 + TypeScript for screens/panels/controllers, keep simulation and Three.js hot paths unreactive, and avoid overlapping other branches' files where practical. `main` is the original implementation base, not proof that these features exist. If a dependency has changed an API, update this spec and the implementation plan before writing code.

## 3. Behavior (BDD — acceptance scenarios)

#### Scenario 1: Trial only

**Given** a trial skin is equipped

**When** player reloads

**Then** preference may restore but no permanent ownership is inferred

#### Scenario 2: Account switch

**Given** user signs out and another signs in

**When** catalog resolves

**Then** no owned items or balance leaks across accounts

#### Scenario 3: Legacy

**Given** saved PAINTS item predates new model

**When** profile migrates

**Then** legit paint remains available with no fabricated currency

#### Scenario 4: Unavailable item

**Given** saved cosmetic ID is invalid or trial expired

**When** equipped resolves

**Then** default appears; no record corruption or checkout

## 4. Interfaces, migration and non-goals

- The owning implementation plan must define the smallest typed contract across affected source modules and deterministic tests before code. No unbounded new dependencies, classes or parallel state stores.
- Do not alter gameplay/ownership/race records incidentally or allow visual Quality to change physics, HUD options, progress or owned inventory.
- Preserve preexisting iPhone/Android browser input, keyboard/mouse, interruption recovery and finish/pause clickability; all new player copy must be bilingual.
- The following are mandatory review risks, with tests assigned in the plan:
1. No purchase authority from localStorage
2. Firestore security/persistence migration must not grant paid items
3. Pricing and exchange rates undecided, don't invent
4. Keep schema minimal to avoid speculation
5. Do not implement real money or operational balance

## 5. Cross-platform visual and performance acceptance

| Area | Required gate |
| --- | --- |
| Mobile | Android Chrome and iOS Safari/Chrome, portrait 320×740 / 390×844 / 412×892; landscape 844×390 / short-screen stress |
| Desktop/tablet | 1440×900 and tablet portrait/landscape with keyboard/mouse/touch as relevant |
| Quality | Low/Medium/High VFX fidelity may change; critical DOM/menu/HUD/ability meaning never disappears |
| Accessibility | `en`/`zh-TW`, safe-area, focus, 44px minimum touch targets, mute, Reduced Motion and VFX disabled |
| Real rendering | Before/after WebGL screenshots and Draw Calls/Triangles/FPS/frame-time p50/p95; note untested physical devices |
| Regression | RED→GREEN→Refactor, local test commands and exact-HEAD GitHub CI, then explicit merge approval |

## 6. Wave / merge gate

**Dependency:** Garage VFX Skins merged; no live currency or payment implementation without separately approved economics.

- [ ] Review and approve spec plus BDD scenarios before implementation.
- [ ] Read branch-local current `CLAUDE.md` and file-scoped rules; sync newest `main` after dependencies merge.
- [ ] Implement only per [the companion Superpowers Plan](../plans/2026-10-31-garage-economy-foundation-plan.md).
- [ ] Verify tests, actual screen/input behavior and performance; record evidence and only then check off relevant `TODO.md` items, with partial requirements remaining unchecked.
- [ ] Do not open PR or merge to `main` without explicit user authorization.

### Required shared constraints

- Baseline main commit: `bea47cf61c162b4341021fa6d24ca45850af7796`. Product requirements: [UX/UI source TODO](https://github.com/weskao/skyline-rush/blob/feature/ux-ui-combo-mobile-controls/TODO.md); **they have not yet been merged into main**. Before implementation reconcile this source into the working branch without overwriting newer main data.
- Planning-only commit. No source edits, no tests run, no merge/PR/deploy. Product spec and BDD are intended implementation contracts, not proof of behavior.
- Read the current `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/rules/ui-architecture.md`, `performance-review.md`, `device-quality.md`, `touch-input.md`, `ui-phase-interactions.md` and domain-specific rules; follow newer revisions when implementing.
- New UI: Vue 3 + strict TypeScript (SFC `<script setup lang="ts">`), typed adapters for necessary JS physics/Three.js render loop. No Vue reactive writes or DOM queries per frame.
- Android Chrome and iPhone Safari/Chrome portrait + landscape, tablet and desktop; `en`/`zh-TW`, Low/Medium/High, VFX off, Reduced Motion, muted audio; preserve critical controls/data at every tier.
- Performance first with before/after real WebGL evidence, FPS, p50/p95 frame-time, Draw Calls, Triangles, GPU uploads; screen overlays and touch controls must not block the game.
- TDD RED→GREEN→Refactor, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, `npm run test:layout`, `npm run test:browser`, World Tour/Cloud Save when relevant, `make verify`, exact-HEAD GitHub CI. Only mark `TODO.md` item `- [x]` after each *fully implemented and verified* requirement is complete; never mark for a plan.
- Each agent owns its feature branch and specific files; dependent implementation waits for prerequisites merged into `main` after user approval. If source TODO is absent on the branch, first integrate the approved spec using an explicit non-destructive merge/cherry-pick and do not copy stale contents over main.
